            <h1>Stiphen King</h1>
            <p>Author: steaphen king</p>
            <p>Description: Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son of Donald and Nellie
                Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother,
                David, were raised by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana, where his
                father's family was at the time, and in Stratford, Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother
                brought her children back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury, had become
                incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by her sisters to take over the physical care of
                the elderly couple. Other family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support. After
                Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the kitchens of Pineland, a nearby
                residential facility for the mentally challenged.</p>

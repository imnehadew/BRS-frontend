        <h1>Privacy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: June 30, 2020. To see prior version, click here<br>
            <br>

            Goodreads LLC (together with its affiliates, “Goodreads,” “we,” or “us”) knows that you care how information
            about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly.
            <br>
            <br>
            Goodreads LLC is a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”). The information we collect is subject to the
            Amazon Privacy Notice, except as otherwise stated in this notice. By visiting or using Goodreads.com and
            related services (the “Service”), you are accepting the practices described in the Amazon Privacy Notice as
            supplemented by this notice (the “Privacy Notice”). Please note that, if you have an account on
            www.amazon.com, information gathered by Goodreads may be correlated with any personal information that
            Amazon.com has and used by Goodreads and Amazon to improve the services we offer
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>User Content and Messages</h1>
        <p>The Service allows you to post User Content, as defined in our Terms of Use. Any User Content you post
            becomes available to the public via the Service. User Content includes, but is not limited to, reviews,
            comments, and visual content. If you remove User Content, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived
            pages or if other users have copied or stored your User Content.
            <br>
            <br>
            Goodreads takes reasonable measures to keep messages that you send to other Members through the Service
            private between you and the recipient. However, even if you have deleted the message from your Goodreads
            inbox or outbox, copies of the message may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users
            have copied or stored the message.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>email</h1>
        <p>TBy providing Goodreads your e-mail address you consent to us sending you Service-related notices, including
            any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your e-mail address to
            send you other messages, such as newsletters, changes to features, notices of member-initiated content, or
            special offers (“Other Messages”). If you do not want to receive Other Messages, you may opt out by changing
            your e-mail preference settings in the account settings section of Goodreads.com after you have signed in
            using your personal password. Opting out may prevent you from receiving e-mail messages regarding updates,
            improvements, or offers. You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>privacy setting</h1>
        <p>Your name is used when you invite another person to join Goodreads, or when you request to add another member
            to your friends list. To the extent that you do not wish to have your name shared in this manner, you should
            not make use of these services. You can modify, delete, and set your privacy setting for information you
            provide us any time in the account settings section of Goodreads.com after you have signed in using your
            personal password.</p>

            your last name, and what sort of e-mail notifications you will receive from the Service. You may, of course,
            decline to submit personally identifiable information through Goodreads, in which case Goodreads may not be

        <h1>Your Choices About Your Information</h1>
        <p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Goodreads does not
            knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such
            persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including
            your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any
            personal information to or on Goodreads. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal
            information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that
            information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child
            under 13, please contact us.</p>
